# Description

Vision is currently available in the latest version of VS Code. Read more about the feature in our [release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_98#_copilot-vision-preview). This extension will soon be deprecated in favor of this built-in image flow in Github Copilot Chat. 

Vision for Copilot Preview is an extension that enhances chat interactions by enabling users to leverage advanced vision capabilities. This preview feature allows users to attach images directly as contextual input, enriching conversations and enabling more dynamic, visually-supported responses. 

### Chat
For now, users can experience the image attachment flow in the chat panel by using their own OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter keys, or by running Ollama locally. Get started by easily attaching images from the clipboard or dragging them directly into the chat.

The response provides a basic HTML structure with a header, navigation links (Home, About, Contact), and a link to an external CSS file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-vision/refs/heads/main/assets/demo.gif)

### Quick Fixes
Additionally, users can generate or refine alt text for images in markdown, HTML, JSX, or TSX documents with the provided code actions, simplifying the process of incorporating descriptive text for better context and accessibility. Alt text quick fixes work for images in the workspace and image URLs. 

![An example markdown document displays a quick fix feature for generating alt text, resulting in the automatic insertion of an alt tag and a value. The user is then prompted with a different quick fix to refine the alt text using an input box. After the user enters and submits their refined description, the alt text is updated accordingly.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-vision/refs/heads/main/assets/demo-alt-text.gif)

# How do I attach images to the chat panel?
1. Copy and Paste an image from the clipboard.
2. With an image in the clipboard, select the `Attach Context` button and select `Image from Clipboard` from the quick pick.
3. Click the `Attach Context` button and select an image in the workspace or `Screenshot Window`.
4. Drag and drop from anywhere outside VS Code into the chat panel.
5. From the command palette, select `Copilot Vision: Troubleshoot`. This is very useful for screen reader and beginner users for diagnosing issues in one's workspace.

# How do I use Azure OpenAI?
1. In VS Code, set `"copilot.vision.provider": "AzureOpenAI"`
2. Create the required Azure resources: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal
3. Set your full endpoint URL.
  a. Go to `https://ai.azure.com/`
  b. Choose "Deployments" from the options.
  c. Create a deployment if you don't have one. 
  d. Click on the Name of the depoloyment. Here you'll be able to see the Target URI and Key.
  e. In VS Code, set `copilot.vision.azureEndpoint` to your Target URI.
  f. In VS Code, run "Copilot Vision: Set Current Model's API Key" and paste the key from step d.

# How do I use OpenRouter?
1. In VS Code, set `"copilot.vision.provider": "OpenRouter"`
2. Get an API key from https://openrouter.ai/
3. In VS Code, run "Copilot Vision: Set a Provider and Model" command.
4. Select "OpenRouter" from the provider list.
5. Enter a vision-capable model name (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o`, `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `google/gemini-pro-vision`).
6. When prompted, enter your OpenRouter API key.

OpenRouter provides unified access to multiple AI models through a single API. You can browse available vision models and their pricing at https://openrouter.ai/models?q=vision

# How do I use Ollama?

## Local Usage (No API Key Required)
1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai/
2. Download a vision-capable model (e.g., `ollama pull llava`, `ollama pull llava:13b`, or `ollama pull bakllava`).
3. Start Ollama if it's not already running (it typically runs automatically on installation).
4. In VS Code, run "Copilot Vision: Set a Provider and Model" command.
5. Select "Ollama" from the provider list.
6. Enter the Ollama endpoint (default is `http://localhost:11434`).
7. Enter the model name you downloaded (e.g., `llava`, `llava:13b`, `bakllava`).
8. When prompted for an API key, you can enter any value (local usage doesn't require authentication).

## Cloud Usage (API Key Required)
1. Sign up for Ollama Cloud at https://ollama.com/
2. Create an API key from your Ollama Cloud dashboard.
3. In VS Code, run "Copilot Vision: Set a Provider and Model" command.
4. Select "Ollama" from the provider list.
5. Enter the Ollama cloud endpoint: `https://ollama.com/api`
6. Enter a cloud model name (e.g., `llava:13b`, `qwen2-vl:7b`, or other cloud-hosted vision models).
7. When prompted for an API key, enter your Ollama Cloud API key.

Ollama allows you to run vision models locally on your machine (providing privacy and offline capabilities) or use cloud models. Popular local vision models include:
- `llava` - LLaVA 7B model
- `llava:13b` - LLaVA 13B model (better quality, requires more resources)
- `bakllava` - BakLLaVA model
